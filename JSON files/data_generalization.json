Another secret chamber is said to be located in the Jal Mahal, or Water Palace. This palace is located in the middle of a lake, and it is said that the chamber is accessed through a hidden door underwater. The existence of these secret chambers has never been officially confirmed, and they remain a mystery to this day.

India denied the allegations and accused Canada of harboring pro-Khalistan separatists. As a result of the dispute, India suspended visa services for Canadians and withdrew its high commissioner from Canada",

The Earth rotates from west to east, but because we are on the Earth, we see the Sun as moving in the opposite direction.
